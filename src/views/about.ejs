  <h3>Collaboration</h3>
  <p>WWe love teaming up with people on projects of all shapes and sizes…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>with for people who have great ideas for a project, product or business they are starting, but don’t have the technical know-how to get there.</li>
    <li>with other talented developers who need a bit of extra help to polish up a few details on a project, whether it is lending an extra hand, or to bring our specific expertise to fill in gaps in knowledge.</li>
    <li>with other teams (even our competitors!) through the process of developing and maintaining open source / open standards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
  <p>One of the primary goals of VIDVOX Labs is to help and participate in open source development. We do this through…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>helping fund and find funding for open source projects in our communities.</li>
    <li>contributing both time and money to development of open source code and open standards on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>supporting open standards within our own projects and software whenever possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>All Around Excellence</h3>
  <p>To make things that are not just good, but great, we find it important to…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>constantly invest in advancing our own collective expertise, not just technical, and leverage it in all areas of our business, as well as for our clients, customers and communities.</li>
    <li>include talented people from our extended network of creative technologists, designers, and project managers to match the particular needs of a job is a crucial part of our process.</li>
