  </header>

  <h3>Collaboration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We love consulting for people who have great ideas for a project, product or business they are starting, but donâ€™t have the technical know-how to get there.</li>
    <li>We love working with other talented developers who need a bit of extra help to polish up a few details on a project, whether it is lending an extra hand, or to bring our specific expertise to fill in gaps in knowledge.</li>
    <li>We love connecting with other teams (even our competitors!) through the process of developing and maintaining open source / open standards.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>One chief goal of VIDVOX Labs is to help fund and find funding for open source projects in our communities.</li>
    <li>We contribute both time and money to development of open source code and open standards on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>We support open standards within our own projects and software whenever possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technical Excellence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We invest in advancing our own collective expertise, not just technical, and we aim to leverage it in all areas of our business and for our clients / customers.</li>
    <li>Including talented people from our extended network of creative technologists, designers, and project managers is a crucial part of our process.</li>
    <li>Our open source offerings should not just be technically solid, but should also set a standard for excellence by being well documented and accessible to others, including non-developers.</li>
  </ul>
